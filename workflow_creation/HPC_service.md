# Overview over the generic HPC service
This document gives an overview over the CloudFlow HPC service and describes how
to use it to execute Singularity images on an HPC cluster.

_Note:_ You might want to read the [instructions on how to create and register
Singularity images](../service_implementation/basics_singularity.md) first.

## Example workflow
_This documentation is not yet finished. To get started on the topic, head over
to the CloudiFacturing portal and have a look at one of the HPC-waiter
workflows with the following URIs:_
* `http://workflows/sintef/HpcWaiterHardcodedAnselm.owl#HPC_Waiter_Hardcoded_Anselm`
* `http://workflows/sintef/HpcWaiterHardcodedSalomon.owl#HPC_Waiter_Hardcoded_Salomon`

**TODO:** Extend documentation
