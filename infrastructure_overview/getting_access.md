# Getting access
## Where to find the portal
The CloudFlow platform portal in CloudiFacturing is available under
https://api.hetcomp.org.

Note that the portal is a development version which will eventually be replaced.

## How to get access
If you need access to the portal (which will allow you to create and execute
workflows), write a request email to Robert (robert.schittny@sintef.no) and
include the following information:
* Full name
* Email address
* Associated experiment

## How to obtain virtual machines for service development
During the development stages of your CloudFlow web services, it is advised to
use individual virtual machine instances for easier debugging. If you require
a VM, write a request email to Robert (robert.schittny@sintef.no) including a
short description of the service you are developing.
